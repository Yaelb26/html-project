 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>The Commitments</h3>
 <p>A great movie that is a mix between great music and social commentary.</p>
 <h3>Notting Hill</h3>
 <p>No introduction needed. Just a good old romantic comedy from the gold age of romantic comedies.</p>
<h3>In the Name of the Father</h3>
<p>One of the best performances on screen by the greatest actor of our times: Daniel Day Lewis </p>
